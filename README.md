### 🍽️ ServeU

> [ServeU](https://github.com/vinhvn/serve-u) is a private asset repository for authorized users to upload, store, and share files with colleagues, friends, and family!

I worked on this project to fulfill a need I had for an easy-to-use and private repository where I could quickly upload and share files with coworkers and friends. In the process, I learned a lot about the full stack application building process, dealing with CORS and server setup, and adding authorization and security to a web app.

### 🐻 Randimals

> [Randimals](https://github.com/vinhvn/randimals) is a TypeScript-friendly NPM package to generate adorable and unique animal IDs for any project!

I worked on this project because I had the need for a random ID generator but I didn't want a completely machined string of characters. To fulfill that need, I created Randimals! I wrote the entire package in TypeScript, adding Types to make sure it usable for others with my use case. In the process, I learned a lot about the TypeScript build system, including Gulp and Browserify.

### ♦️ Online Video Poker

> [Online Video Poker](https://github.com/NAEK2K/online-video-poker) is a web-based and easy-to-access way to scratch that itch for Video Poker!

I worked on this project to build and design a web game amongst a small team, refamiliarizing myself with React and TypeScript. I designed the entire frontend UI / UX for this project in Figma and led the front-facing client development. In the process, I was able to try a different system design for a React app and teach TypeScript to my team.
